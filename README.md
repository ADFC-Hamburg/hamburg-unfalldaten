Simple Leaflet map template for putting points on a map.

### Features
* Reads points from a delimited text file containing `lat` and `lng` columns 
* Clusters point markers dynamically
* Displays properties as an html table in the marker popop
* Filters points by full text search
* All client-side javascript; driven by static content (no reason a geoCSV *couldn't* be created dynamically though...)
* All dependencies included or linked via CDN
